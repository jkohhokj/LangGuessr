# LangGuessr

[LangGuessr]() is a language guessing game inspired by [Apprenti-Polyglotte](https://quiz.apprenti-polyglotte.net/) for people who want to get better at GeoGuessr or just become culturally fluent. A major improvement added is the dynamic news feature which exposes the player to more diverse content.

Currently there are 38 languages supported through the Serpapi API which pulls Google News information. The full list of languages can be found [here](langguessr/app/Data/languages_cut.json) as these are the only languages that Google regularly covers. If any new languages recieve regular coverage or an existing language is discontinued, please submit a pull request.

Another version is WIP and will cover over 300 languages with different levels of difficulty.
